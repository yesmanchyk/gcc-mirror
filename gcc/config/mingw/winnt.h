  /* SEH records offsets relative to the lowest address of the fixed stack
     allocation.  If there is no frame pointer, these offsets are from the
     stack pointer; if there is a frame pointer, these offsets are from the
     value of the stack pointer when the frame pointer was established, i.e.
     the frame pointer minus the offset in the .seh_setframe directive.

     We do not distinguish these two cases, i.e. we consider that the offsets
     are always relative to the "current" stack pointer.  This means that we
     need to perform the fixed stack allocation before establishing the frame
     pointer whenever there are registers to be saved, and this is guaranteed
     by the prologue provided that we force the frame pointer to point at or
     below the lowest used register save area, see ix86_compute_frame_layout.
